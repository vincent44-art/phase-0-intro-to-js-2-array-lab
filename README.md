# Arrays Lab

## Learning Goals

- Practice writing arrays
- Practice using _destructive_ methods to manipulate arrays
- Practice using _nondestructive_ methods to manipulate arrays

## Introduction

We've learned about how arrays work and about the array methods built in to
JavaScript that we can use to manipulate them. Now it's time to practice what
we've learned.

If you haven't already, **fork and clone** this lab into your local environment.
Navigate into its directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files
in Visual Studio Code.

## Instructions
Remember the workflow:

1. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
2. Run the tests using `npm test`.
3. Read the errors; vocalize what they're asking you to do.
4. Write code; repeat steps 2 and 3 often until a test passes.
5. Repeat as needed for the remaining tests.

After you have all the tests passing, remember to commit and push your changes
up to GitHub, then submit your work to Canvas using CodeGrade.
